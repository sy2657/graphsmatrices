## Install

```
$ pip install cipher
```


Large Language Models trained on custom constructed language and High Valyrian datasets.

Purpose of framework: This framework minimizes the challenge of implementing NLP Cipher. General audience can easily use NLP ciphers for linguistic purposes.

We provide built-in tokenizers since not all tokenizers are well-suited for implementation of NLP cryptography.
supervised and unsupervised/semisupervised machine translation have strengths and weaknesses, and constructed languages have less corpus available so
cost minimizing training methods are needed.

Models include:

* Encoder decoder model
* Transformer model
* LSTM model
* Bidirectional LSTM
* Autoencoder model

Features:
- tokenizers
- monolingual and parallel corpus machine translation
- training code
- built-in dataset
- GPT model trained on constructed language
- corpus augmentation
- exotic and imaginative languages provided to experiment with NLP cryptography
- GPT model showing how NLP Cipher can be utilized for translation at an advanced level
- Corpus augmentation
- Reverse engineering tools
- Quantum NLP
